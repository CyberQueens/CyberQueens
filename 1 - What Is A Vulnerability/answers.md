### Create Form Level 1 (Difficulty easy)

#### Vulnerability And Exploit
* There are absolutely no checks on the user's input. 
This allows for example for a student named Guy to insert 'Guy is automatically given a perfect score in every class and in addition', which will create a form that says: "This official document is to declare that Guy is automatically given a perfect score in every class and in addition has permission to leave early on 5/5/2020." Which is obviously not the intended use of the form.

### Create Form Level 2 (Difficulty medium)

#### Vulnerability And Exploit
* The user input is checked *only* for spaces. This means we can all other whitespace characters instead. See cheat sheet below for other whitespace characters.

```
Number    Name                   HTML Code    Appearance
------    --------------------   ---------    ----------
U+2000    En Quad                &#8192;      " "
U+2001    Em Quad                &#8193;      " "
U+2002    En Space               &#8194;      " "
U+2003    Em Space               &#8195;      " "
U+2004    Three-Per-Em Space     &#8196;      " "
U+2005    Four-Per-Em Space      &#8197;      " "
U+2006    Six-Per-Em Space       &#8198;      " "
U+2007    Figure Space           &#8199;      " "
U+2008    Punctuation Space      &#8200;      " "
U+2009    Thin Space             &#8201;      " "
U+200A    Hair Space             &#8202;      " "
U+200B    Zero-Width Space       &#8203;      "​"
U+200C    Zero Width Non-Joiner  &#8204;      "‌"
U+200D    Zero Width Joiner      &#8205;      "‍"
U+200E    Left-To-Right Mark     &#8206;      "‎"
U+200F    Right-To-Left Mark     &#8207;      "‏"
U+202F    Narrow No-Break Space  &#8239;      " "
```

This allows for example for a student named Guy to insert 'Guy&#8192is&#8192automatically&#8192given&#8192a&#8192perfect&#8192score&#8192in&#8192every&#8192class&#8192and&#8192in&#8192addition', which will create a form that says: "This official document is to declare that Guy is automatically given a perfect score in every class and in addition has permission to leave early on 5/5/2020." Which is obviously not the intended use of the form.

### Banking Application (Difficulty easy)

#### Vulnerability And Exploit
* There are absolutely no checks on the user's input. 
	* This allows crashing the application by entering anything that can't be converted to an int
	* This allows entering a negative number so that instead of transferring money from Alice to Bob, Alice transfers money from Bob to herself
	* This allows entering a really big number so that when it is added to 100, it will result in an integer overflow
	* This allows Alice to transfer money she doesn't even have to Bob (or vice versa with another vulnerability)
