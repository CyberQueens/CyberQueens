### Create Form Level 1 (Difficulty easy)

#### Storyline
After a big test, the local high school wants to give out permission slips to students so that they can leave school early. To get a permission slip, students need to fill out an online form with their name and click 'create form'. This form is then automatically printed, stamped, signed, and is ready to be picked up by the student.

#### Tasks
* Find and exploit a vulnerability in the on-line permission slip system

#### Interface
Open 'Create-Form-Level-1.html' with a browser

#### Notes
Level 2 shouldn't be opened until level 1 is complete as level 2 can expose the answer to level 1.
