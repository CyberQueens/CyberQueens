# Vulnerability Research Exercises
Exercises to practice vulnerability hunting

###### Author: Guy Levin

# Required Knowledge For Exercises
* what is a vulnerability (lesson 1)
* python

# Exercises

### Bank Login 1 (Difficulty easy)

#### Storyline
This is the login portal to a bank. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to hack the bank.

#### Tasks
* Find the vulnerability in the program
* Exploit the vulnerability to reach the function ```victory()```
* Fix the vulnerability

#### Interface
Run the code with ```py -3 bank_login_1.py```

---

### Bank Login 2 (Difficulty easy)

#### Storyline
This is the login portal to a bank. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to hack the bank.

#### Tasks
* Find the vulnerability in the program
* Exploit the vulnerability to reach the function ```victory()```
* Code a wrapper program to automatically exploit the vulnerability (take a look at the 'subprocess' module in python)
* Fix the vulnerability

#### Interface
Run the code with ```py -3 bank_login_2.py```

---

### Bank Server 3 (Difficulty hard)

#### Storyline
You have been given access to a bank's code that runs on the banks secure server. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to hack the bank.

#### Tasks
* Find *all* the vulnerabilities in the program
* Write a separate function in ```bank_server_3_client.py``` to exploit each vulnerability found
* Create a function in in ```bank_server_3_client.py``` that uses the vulnerabilities found to "borrow" everyone's money
* Create a function in in ```bank_server_3_client.py``` that uses the vulnerabilities found to to generate new money
* Fix each vulnerability

#### Interface
Run the server's code with ```py -3 bank_server_3.py```. 
Interact with the server over the network with either ```bank_server_3_mini_client.py``` or ```bank_server_3_client.py```.
